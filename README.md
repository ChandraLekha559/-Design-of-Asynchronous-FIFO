# -Design-of-Asynchronous-FIFO
◦ Designed an Asynchronus FIFO using Verilog and simulated using Modelsim-Altera tool.
◦ Used Gray Code encoding for inter-clock domain control data transfer to avoid multi-bit signal transitions.
◦ Implemented Two Flip-Flop Synchronizer to avoid metastability issues in CDC
